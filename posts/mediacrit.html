The man in the video is named Philando Castile and his girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds recorded the footage moments after Castile was shot by a police officer while reaching for his wallet/ID while their 4-year old daughter was sitting in the back. So far this video has been viewed over 5.6 million times and shared over 317,000 times. The images that I viewed on Facebook, and later all other social media outlets were gruesome and I couldn&rsquo;t see the overall benefit of them being online. In a world where we already have so many images and visuals that portray the black community in a bad light, what kind of impact do these portrays devalue black existence.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In psychology, Habitualization is referred to as &ldquo;a learning process wherein there is a decrease in response to a stimulus after being repeatedly exposed to it.&rdquo; This concept is explained by stating humans may learn to ignore a stimulus because of repeated exposure to it. Several studies have been conducted and concluded that the more time individuals spend watching violent media depictions, whether that be video games, news stories, movies or television shows, their emotional response is a lot less responsive and their sympathy for the victim decreases dramatically </span><span class="c1 c3">(Krahe)</span><span class="c1 c3">. Proving that Americans are becoming desensitized to videos of police brutality is very similar to studies that conclude habitually playing violent games not only desensitizing individuals to violence but also results in an increase in violent behavior. In 2006, a study was conducted by Bruce Bartholow, Brad Bushman, and Marc Sestir that involved event related brain potential data to compare responses by violent and nonviolent video games users to violent stimuli. Bartholow et al. found that the more violent video games users had significantly lower emotional responses to violent pictures </span><span class="c1 c3">(Bartholow et al)</span><span class="c8 c1 c3">. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February 26, 2012, Trayvon Martin was fatally shot and killed by a neighborhood watch guard in Florida while walking back to his father&rsquo;s house from the corner store. I remember sitting with my dad the next morning, watching (what I thought was) the country cry in outrage over the unjustified murder of an unarmored teenager by a white-Hispanic man. I remember hearing the recorded 911 calls that covered Martin and his acquitted murderer moments before his death. The Trayvon Martin shooting jump started a national conversation for months and reassured the American population that racism and discrimination is alive and well. Two years later in 2014, story broke that Eric Garner, a 43 year old African-American man was killed after being held in a &ldquo;chokehold&rdquo; for 15-19 seconds by NYPD officers while being arrested for selling single cigarettes. Unfortunately, this routine of seeing the deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of others has become something we see and live through on a day-to-day basis. This definitely is not new to the American population, it was only 25 years ago that the video recording of Rodney King being beaten aired nationwide. The fear of becoming the next Rodney King, Eric Garner or Trayvon Martin is still prevalent in amongst the black community, however the only difference is how often we are witnessing this fear online. The viewings of such horrific crimes are more available online than any Hollywood film and the development of police body and dashboard cameras has allowed this to become even more publicly available. It is terrifying that these men are no longer men to be uplifted or condemned, but have transformed into just another hashtag. The people choosing to record these vicious acts think they are publishing powerful forms of documentation against the discrimination and violence faced by the African-American community, but in fact, all they are doing are &ldquo;deadening our collective senses </span><span class="c1 c3">(Smith)</span><span class="c8 c1 c3">.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less than 24 hours after the death of Alton Sterling, father of four, images and videos of his fatal death were spread across all forms of media. Images of bloodied Sterling spread out on the parking lot floor with multiple visible gunshot wounds in his body could be found on any and all social media sites; with a simple google search anyone (including Sterling&rsquo;s own children) could watch the brutal murder of Alton Sterling. The NY Daily News even made the decision to plaster this gruesome image on the cover of their paper days later </span><span class="c1 c3">(Amobi)</span><span class="c1 c3">. In our society online media is so prevalent in our to day-to-day life, and images, both wanted and unwanted, can be sent, received and posted at any time of the day. Have we gone too far? These videos are desensitizing the American people to images of black death and violence being perpetrated against the black community. The more we see these images, play and replay the videos, listen to the last words of the victims, the less moved we are by them. Even if we still experience feelings of anger or rage, the more we are exposed to these images, the easier it will be to watch the next time around. This is referred to as Exposure Therapy, a technique in behavior therapy used to treat anxiety disorders </span><span class="c1 c3">(American Psychological Association)</span><span class="c1 c3">.&rdquo; </span><span class="c1 c3">The criticism with Exposure Therapy, however, is that it only works for the short term. For the long term, it usually increases the fear for the patient </span><span class="c1 c3">(American Psychological Association)</span><span class="c1 c3">. CNN recently published an article which summarized the stance of the medical community, citing the American Academy of Family Physician&rsquo;s 2015 report which explains how the excessive use of force by police &ldquo;poses a serious ongoing public health issue that disproportionately affects minority communities </span><span class="c1 c3">(Love)</span><span class="c1 c3">.</span><span class="c8 c1 c3">&rdquo; The media neglects to put the black communities mental health in front of their need to gain consumerism. The American people are so content with seeing these images, that major media companies neglect to even provide trigger warnings for individuals; instead, we are given the option to auto-play videos after they have concluded. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c3">Desensitization is defined as &ldquo;a short-term, immediate drop in concern or sympathy about violence </span><span class="c1 c3">(Scharrer)</span><span class="c1 c3">.&rdquo; Scharrer describes desensitization is &ldquo;a complex phenomenon with psychological, cognitive, and affective roots and manifestations.&rdquo; She conducted a survey that studied participants&rsquo; self reports of how disturbing, shocking, or troubling they found certain things following consistent media exposure. As a result of her study, sensitivity to violence (or lack thereof) has a direct relationship with news items containing violence, resulting in self reports of emotional responses and perceptions of normalcy (Scharrer). The role of empathy also plays a strong function in studying the effects of violence in the media. John B. Nezlek and colleagues define empathy as &ldquo;the capacity to recognize, comprehend, and re-experience another person&rsquo;s emotions </span><span class="c1 c3">(Nezlek et al.)</span><span class="c1 c3">.&rdquo; The relationship between empathy and desensitization is so close that most researchers use empathy as a predictor of desensitization. Developing empathy towards violence against others is imperative amongst adolescents because that is the age where empathy and compassion is starting to form. If individuals start to lose empathy, than their drive to want to fix a situation will no longer be there because they lack the passion to fix the situation. Empathy means that the individual has an understanding of another person or group of people&rsquo;s situation, so without empathy individuals won&rsquo;t be able to understand nor grief with others who have lost.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it be a black and white image of Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith or a 4 minute video of Tamir Rice, these images highlighting and exposing injustice in American society have become just another history lesson or public spectacle for entertainment. One writer says that, &ldquo;we consume these images for public debate and recycle them as energy to push our protests </span><span class="c1 c3">(Anderson)</span><span class="c8 c1 c3">.&rdquo; The death of unarmed black males should not be publicized for activist, need, purpose or point. The consistent publishing of these images takes the crime and removes the victim. The victims of theses crimes are no longer remembered for their lives prior to these deadly moments. The &ldquo;metamorphosis of their bodies into [rallying points and media commodities] puts us at risk of desensitizing ourselves to their fatalities.&rdquo; We recognize the original intent for posting these images, however the consistency and abundance of postings centered around black fatalities show how little the American people value our death.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c8 c1 c3"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c1 c11 c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c1 c3 c11"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c1 c11 c3"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c8 c1 c11 c3">Works Cited</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c1 c11 c3"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1">American Psychological Association. &ldquo;What is Exposure Therapy?&rdquo; </span><span class="c0">Division 12, </span><span class="c1"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.div12.org/sites/default/files/WhatIsExposureTherapy.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1525461633508000">http://www.div12.org/sites/default/files/WhatIsExposureTherapy.pdf</a></span><span class="c1">.
