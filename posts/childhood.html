Marketers have managed to find a way to advertise their company&rsquo;s messages towards each and every one of these children. In 2006, marketers were spending nearly $1.4 billion per month on advertising towards children, with over $4 billion spent by the food industry alone. In the United States alone, McDonald&rsquo;s spent a sole $1.43 billion in advertising. With all of this money being spent on advertisements, it is important to see if companies are getting a return on their investment. In an AdWeek article titled, </span><span class="c2 c4">A Look At Kid&rsquo;s Exposure to Ads</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;by Lucia Moses, Moses explains how kids are being exposed to about 25,600 advertisements every year and more than 40% of their exposure came from non-children tv shows. The billions of dollars being spent annually seems to be worth it with kids under age 11 spending nearly $18 billion a year in the US and teens spending a whopping $160 billion a year. Although these numbers are extremely high, they do not compare to the amount of money spent by adults based on influences by children. Kids influence nearly $700 billion in purchases every year from adults. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">Advertisers realized how many purchases are influenced by children and the families with children. Adults take into account their children when buying cars, houses, cell phones, clothes, and even family vacations. This has forced marketers to create advertisements targeted toward children that will help influence adults in making certain purchases. For example, the minivan was originally created because kids needed more leg room and car companies wanted a vehicle to appeal to those &ldquo;soccer moms.&rdquo; However, society decided that the sliding door vehicle wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;cool&rdquo; enough anymore, which prompted companies to target their SUV commercials towards children instead to give a classier alternative. Parents now make it a goal to find hotels and resorts that have some sort of entertainment for their kids. Major media companies such as Disney and Nickelodeon began creating theme parks and attractions that were centered around icons and characters children looked up to. Disney&rsquo;s amusement park in Orlando, Florida, Walt Disney World, has earned $13 billion in revenue so far this year with the majority of spending from visitors coming from tickets, merchandise, and hotel rates. Disney is able to capitalize off of its own television shows and movies through these amusement parks by giving children a chance to interact with their favorite characters one-on-one. Not only can children watch Mickey Mouse on TV, but they can vacation with them and when they get to the park they can buy the Mickey Mouse ears to look like Mickey Mouse. This prevalence of the Disney brand was similar to a term mentioned in the documentary </span><span class="c2 c7">Consuming Kids: The Commercialization of Childhood</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;called 360 degree immersive marketing. This term refers to a concept conducted by marketers to try to include the brand identity into a holistic approach so that the brand is in touch with and visible to the customers at all times. Children experience this all 24/7 in their life. While watching the documentary, it was hard to keep myself from relating what the moderators were saying to what I experienced as a child. I remembered having a minor obsession with Barbie dolls and the Barbie brand. I would wake up from sleeping in my Barbie pajamas in my Barbie comforters to brush my teeth with my Barbie toothbrush and go to school with my Barbie backpack on, only to go to lunch with my Barbie lunchbox. I remember always asking for McDonalds because I knew I would get a Barbie toy to play with in my Happy Meal and my parents never neglect to remind me of the constant temper tantrums I would throw when I saw a Barbie doll on the shelf. That was 10 years ago but the media/advertising environment today for children and teens has changed dramatically. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">In a research brief, </span><span class="c4 c2">Advertising to Children and Teens: Current Practices</span><span class="c1">, the writer points out how advertising efforts have been embedded into the everyday content for kids and teens including: immersive websites, video games, mobile ads, social media, company sponsored school events/equipment, and viral marketing. All of this information is important to mention because of the overall purpose of advertisements and the intensity of these marketing efforts, consumption. Ultimately, the goal of marketers is to increase sales and marketers are willing to do whatever it takes to sell their product, service or brand. The problem in that is out of the 25,600 yearly advertisements that children watch, a wide proportion of them are centered around food, beverages and candy companies. The Rudd Center determined that, in 2011, fast-food restaurants, candy and cereal ads accounted for just under half of all food and beverage ads exposed to children and adolescents. The childhood obesity epidemic is a serious public health problem in the United States that has substantial long-term economic and social issues. The American Psychological Association concluded that nearly 20% of our youth are overweight and obesity rates amongst pre-school children are steadily increasing. The problem is that most children under 8 do not understand the persuasive intent behind the advertisements. Food advertisements make up 50 percent of ad time on child shows and these advertisements are dominated by unhealthy food options (34% for candy/snacks, 28% for cereal, 10% for fast food, 4% for dairy products, and 1% for fruit juices). There are rarely, if ever, any advertisements encouraging healthy food options; this has forced a lot of initiatives such as: Nickelodeon&rsquo;s Worldwide Day of Play and Michelle Obama&rsquo;s &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Move.&rdquo; Children aged 8-12 receive the highest level of exposure to food advertisements and that age is a critical stage in child development because they are establishing food habits, making their own food choices and choosing where they want to spend their money. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">Children are not able to fully understand the intent behind these companies marketing efforts, making them more susceptible to fall as consumers to these products. Children are trained to become consumers and influencers as little as infancy and advertisers have found a way to reach their target audience at all times of the day. With this influence of media and entertainment so prevalent in society, we need to make room for more positive messages being sent to the children and adolescents being exposed to these advertisements. Low self-esteem, obesity, lack of focus, and mental health problems are just some of the results of these heavy marketing efforts towards adolescents. Companies need to be more aware of the effects their messages are sending to its consumers, and parents need to be more aware of what exactly their children are watching and be able to distinguish an advertisement from actual content. </span></p></body></html>
