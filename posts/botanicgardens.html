The need to preserve our planet for future generations is something that majority of the international community can agree on. Climate change and global warming are international crisis that, with proper care and attention, can be handled; however if we neglect to act on this issue effectively then the quality of life for our children in 2036 will be far worse than expected. One would think that it would be common sense to want to deal with these issues head on, however the ignorance and lack of commitment have proven that this problem is no longer (nor has ever been) something that officials are choosing to deal with diligently. The leaders whom we have elected to represent our best interest have decided that more &ldquo;important&rdquo; things need to be discussed, and the future sustainability of the planet we currently live on will have to wait till further notice. The lack of coverage of environmental issues in the media has also kept the people in the dark to what it really occurring right now. Major media companies refuse to report on issues that actually affect the international community, and have chosen to shift their, and our, attention to scandal, emails, and Kardashians. If these broadcasting networks neglect to create the conversation, the general public will neglect to address the issue and the American people will never play a role in solving the problem. Informing the public is key in maintaining a strong democracy and if the news stations won&rsquo;t educate, then other measures need to be taken to make sure current and future generations are educated on issues that actually affect us. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6 c0">Researchers spend a great deal of time investigating the media&rsquo;s role in this problem, however I plan to inform readers on how education through out-of-classroom experiences to adolescents, the Botanic Garden in particular, will help to improve their drive to take action on environmental issues (i.e. climate change). I will discuss the current educational programs offered (or lack thereof) by botanic gardens, focusing on the Unites States Botanic Garden in Washington D.C., in order to show the lack of depth these programs really have. This will then lead into a discussion on how these out-of-classroom learning settings act as a constructive site for education on sustainable development. Ultimately, I will argue how botanic gardens and other outside learning environments need to create a space for adolescents to learn as well as discuss current and possible attitudes towards climate change and other environmental issues. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Before entering this conversation, it is important to gain perspective on the current motivations and outcomes of visitors to Botanic Gardens. Public gardens attract a significant number of visitors every year and some have become major tourist attractions across the international community including some of the most prevalent ones - Jardim Bot&acirc;nico in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the Singapore Botanic Garden, and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden in New York. Over 200 million people visit a Botanic Garden each year, that is 1 in 33 people worldwide (</span><span class="c0">Chang</span><span class="c0">). Botanic Gardens are notable for their design, features and purpose so it is not surprising that researchers were able to narrow down the key motivations behind visitors. These motivations include appreciation of the aesthetic and rare qualities of plants; interest in garden design and landscaping techniques used in different periods of history; admiration of gardens&rsquo; scenery and &lsquo;ambience&rsquo;; and pleasure in being outdoors (</span><span class="c0">Connell &amp; Meyer</span><span class="c0">). The peaceful and calm atmosphere of the gardens is a main cause behind visitors deciding to go to the gardens. A study was conducted between two urban public gardens - the Brooklyn Botanic Garden (BBG), in Brooklyn, NY and the New York Botanical &nbsp;Garden (NYBG), &nbsp;in Bronx, NY. The research tool was designed as an exit survey for every 1 out of 10 visitors leaving the gardens. A total of 206 surveys were completed between the BBG and NYBG. Below is a table outlining the researcher&rsquo;s results of their of the study. The reasons for visiting garden are listed in order from most important to least important and survey respondents ranked the importance of 10 reasons on a scale from 1 (not at all important) to 7 (extremely important). As a result, the motivations behind visiting the gardens were grouped into the following categories, from most to least important: relaxation, stress reduction, inspiration, fun/social activities, change of pace, educational awareness, special event, nothing better to do, tour of the garden, class at the garden. Notice that the most important reasons residents identified for visiting the two gardens were relaxation, stress reduction, and inspiration (</span><span class="c0">Bennett &amp; Swasey</span><span class="c6 c0">).</span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 192.00px;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2016-11-22 at 9.36.53 AM.png" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 192.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c6 c0">Figure 1: Means and significant difference among importance of reasons for visiting gardens (Bennett &amp; Swasey)</span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c6 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The significance of this information is that the visitor motivations do not align with the hopes of botanic garden managers. According to the The United States Botanic Garden website, their mission includes 1) promoting botanical knowledge through the cultivation of a collection of plants, 2) presenting displays of plants, exhibits and educational programs to the Congress, and 3) fostering sustainability and conservation (U.S. Botanic Garden About Us). Regardless of the missions advertised on the USBG website, visitor motivations remain centered around relaxation and stress reduction; however that is important, the overall motives and outcomes from visitors to these gardens should have some relation to environmental attitudes. Expanding educational efforts amongst visitors and having even the slightest impact on visitor outcome surrounding environmental awareness and conservation is something that botanic gardens should focus on (BGCI). I personally noticed the lack of emphasis placed on creating a relationship between visitors and environmental issues. The role of Botanic Gardens in the social and scientific community has always been to conserve and educate. It was during the 16th and 17th century that &ldquo;the age of exploration and the beginnings of international trade&rdquo; began to arise, which encouraged the international community to implement new safe spaces for cultivation (BGCI). According to the Botanic Gardens Conservation International, in order to be considered a botanic garden, the garden must meet a specific criteria including but not limited to: an underlying scientific basis for collection, open to the public, maintenance of research programs in plant taxonomy, etc (BGCI Definition). Today, botanic gardens hold many responsibilities - research, conservation, teaching, (public) education, and recreation </span><span class="c0">(Boger &amp; Sellman)</span><span class="c6 c0">. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Understanding visitor outcomes has been a focal point among a number of the Botanic Gardens and studies have revealed a variety of psychological, social, health, and community benefits from visitors on their experiences. The outcomes/benefits of the visitor also depends heavily on the motivations behind the visitor. Taking this into account, Researchers have conducted a number of studies to view the correlation between physical attributes of the Botanic Garden and visitor outcomes. Attributes, however, are not always physical (plant life, environment) because, as mentioned previously, the majority of visitors choose to visit the gardens for personal attributes such as relaxation, spending time with family or friends, or even participating in a specific activity (tours, class, special event) (Figure 1). Botanic Garden managers can use this correlation &ldquo;to develop garden characteristics that provide [a] more meaningful [experience]&rdquo; (</span><span class="c0">Wassenberg</span><span class="c0">). Current research on individual satisfaction after visiting botanic gardens has been limited to studies on community wide benefits, stress reduction, health benefits and visitor satisfaction as a clairvoyant for the return of it&rsquo;s visitors or word of mouth recommendation. However, the scientific community lacks any information studying the correlation between botanic gardens and the individual&rsquo;s personal values towards plant life, ecology, and the environment after visitation (</span><span class="c0">Wassenberg</span><span class="c6 c0">). </span></p><p class="c20"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a growing number of people participating in gardening as a leisure activity and watching gardening television programs as well as a new widespread coverage of environmental issues in modern media. These modern lifestyle choices have been directly linked to the increased numbers of gardening visiting (</span><span class="c0">Ballantyne</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;et al.). The 21st century has seen increased awareness and concern about the human impact upon the environment and botanic gardens are serving as formal and informal learning environments for its visitors. Botanic gardens have the potential to serve the international community as not only an informal learning environment that can promote the importance of plant life, habitats and conversation but can help to shape the personal values, attitudes and actions of it&rsquo;s visitors (</span><span class="c0">Botanic Gardens Conservation International 2010</span><span class="c0">). The </span><span class="c0">Council Heads of the Australian Botanic Gardens</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;claim that a major impact of botanic gardens needs to be raising public awareness on the importance of biodiversity because of the &ldquo;appreciation [formed over] the need to preserve natural habitats, to an understanding of the threats and consequences of loss of biodiversity, and to an appreciation of counteractive measures that can be taken </span><span class="c0">(The Council Heads of the Australian Botanic Gardens)</span><span class="c6 c0">.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The United States Botanic Garden (USBG) in Washington D.C. offers a Landscape for Life program, a collaboration between the USBG and the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center at the University of Texas that teaches individuals to work with nature in their garden</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;abstain from damaging the environment&rsquo;s ability to clean air and water </span><span class="c0">(USBG Landscape for Life)</span><span class="c0">. Programs like these are important to promote because of the number of conventional gardens in the United States, and the lack information regarding the impact they have on the environment&rsquo;s ability to support plant life. For school children, the USBG also offers a number of additional </span><span class="c0">on site</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;resources for students to learn about plant life and biodiversity. One of the more prominent ones is a plant-based curriculum created for teachers to help assist with self-guided field trips. The teacher&rsquo;s guide helps teachers and chaperones lead students to ask questions as they discover new things about the life, design, benefits of plants through investigations initiated by their teachers </span><span class="c0">(USBG Landscape for Life)</span><span class="c0">. Besides this curriculum, students are also enabled to take part in a variety of &ldquo;passport&rdquo; or journal entry programs that help the students to explore the gardens different aspects of biodiversity including: Parts of a Plant, Plants and Food, the History of Plant Expeditions and the USBG&rsquo;s current plant collection. The Plants and Food pamphlet includes a number of plants that could be used for food(the name, picture, and description) along with a small exercise that asks students to find one of the plants in the gardens and draw a sketch of that plant </span><span class="c0">(Plant and Food Pamphlet)</span><span class="c6 c0">. These interactive gimmicks offered by the gardens are more of a guided tour pamphlet then an educational resource. I agree they help to keep students engaged and could help spark interest into the environmental science world, however, they do not provide students with information that can have a lasting impact on their attitude toward environmental issues. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Botanic Gardens offer a number of interactive programs for its visitors including exhibits, displays, interpretive signage and guided tours with specific themes. Visitors are given many opportunities during their visit to learn more about plant life, conservation and biodiversity. Some gardens also include free printed pamphlets, guidebooks, maps and brochures that outline self-guided walks. Community programs and courses are also offered throughout the week on topics such as but not limited to: propagation, weed control and plant adaptations, while others host annual displays and plant sales by local horticultural groups (</span><span class="c0">Ballantyne</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;et al.). Studies have shown gardening to have the potential to influence students in several ways (</span><span class="c0">Dirks &amp; Orvis</span><span class="c0">). Out of school learning settings such as museums, zoos, and botanic gardens play an important role in contributing to the sustainable preservation of nature and our environment. This out-of-school learning setting is a concept that involves students gaining experiences, both curricular and non-curricular, outside the traditional classroom setting </span><span class="c0">(Wikipedia)</span><span class="c0">. Out-of-school learning experiences are very important in today&rsquo;s education system, however they are drastically undervalued and most people do not see the long-term impacts these programs, whether it be field trips, study abroad programs, or the average after school program, have on the child. A study at UCLA actually concluded that these out-of-school learning activities play a huge role in affecting not only academic achievement but juvenile crime </span><span class="c0">(Goldschmidt and Huang)</span><span class="c0">. This researched tracked a total of 6,000 students, studying their academic and juvenile crime history and found that students who consistently attended the Los Angeles biggest after-school program demonstrated a significant reduction in the juvenile crime problem compared to students with inconsistent attendance. These out-of-school learning experiences help to strengthen communities and personal interest in education by showing students that there is another life outside of their everyday environment. Especially for students in </span><span class="c0">poverty-stricken</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;circumstances, it is easy to think that it doesn&rsquo;t get any better but these out-of-school experiences give students a deeper look into the outside world. A study conducted by a group of researchers examining out-of-school activities and their impact on young people&rsquo;s learning </span><span class="c0">(Wikeley et al.)</span><span class="c6 c0">. Ultimately, they found that &ldquo;the perceptions of themselves as successful contributors to society were enhanced (Wikeley et al.).&rdquo; These experiences had such a huge impact on the lives of these students that they began to influence future career aspirations. For example, one participant took up Karate as his after-school activity and that same student decided to enroll in the Army Academy for middle school children. This shows the impact out-of-school learning settings can have on students and their overall perceptions of the outside world. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A study conducted</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;by Dr. Daniela Sellmann at a botanical garden in the South of Germany </span><span class="c0">among</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;114 students aged 14-19 aimed at comprehensively examining the effectiveness of a specially designed climate change program. The study looked to investigate the participant&rsquo;s knowledge, connectedness with nature, environmental attitudes and the conceptions about climate change after a visit to the botanical garden. The results confirmed findings from other research on other out of school learning settings and found that botanic gardens serve as appropriate learning sites for education for sustainable development (</span><span class="c0">Sellmann</span><span class="c0">). Improving individual&rsquo;s literacy on climate change can help improve behaviors that could collectively lower our carbon footprint and contribute to slowing pace of climate change. Climate change literacy was defined by the The </span><span class="c0">U.S Global Change Research Program</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;as &ldquo;an understanding of your influence on climate and climate&rsquo;s influence on you and society.&rdquo; Communicating about climate change using only scientific information has had limited influence on the public&rsquo;s attitudes, perceptions, and self-efficacy towards climate change (</span><span class="c0">Kelly</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;et al.). Botanic Gardens and other outside learning environments need to create a space for visitors to discuss current and possible attitudes towards climate change and other environmental issues. Forcing ecological knowledge become a main outcome of visitors can help to create more literate and empathetic </span><span class="c0">individuals within</span><span class="c6 c0">&nbsp;the community. Once visitors have learned about these specific issues in these environments, they will be prompted to take action.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">My goal is not for schools to reevaluate their entire education system,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">I simply ask school boards to take into account all aspects of learning whether it be in school, at home or out-of school. All of these things </span><span class="c0">contribute to</span><span class="c6 c0">&nbsp;the overall success of the individual student and each student learns in their own way. With over 800 botanic gardens across the international community and 200 million annual visitors, recognizing and understanding the effect we have on the environment is imperative, and studying the visitor outcomes will help to create social change for future generations. Focusing educational efforts toward adolescents is imperative to increase the possibility of community engagement/education regarding conservation, to incite pro-conservation attitudes, and to encourage the public to support conservation efforts within their community.</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c6 c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c6 c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c6 c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c6 c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c6 c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c6 c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c6 c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c6 c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c6 c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c6 c0"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c6 c0">Works Cited</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Ballantyne, Roy et al. &ldquo;Environmental awareness, interest and motives of Botanic Gardens visitors: Implications for interpretive practice.&rdquo; </span><span class="c0 c1">Tourism Management,</span><span class="c6 c0">&nbsp;2007, pp. 439-444, DOI: 10.1016/j.tourman.2007.05.006</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Bennett, Ellen Sullivan and Swasey, James E. &ldquo;Perceived Stress Reduction in Urban Public Gardens.&rdquo; </span><span class="c0 c1">Hort Technology, </span><span class="c0">vol. 6, no. 2, Apr.-June 1996, pp. 125-128, </span><span class="c4 c0"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://horttech.ashspublications.org/content/6/2/125.full.pdf%2Bhtml&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1525460810357000">http://horttech.ashspublications.org/content/6/2/125.full.pdf+html</a></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">BGCI. &ldquo;The History of Botanic Gardens.&rdquo; </span><span class="c0 c1">Botanic Gardens Conservation International, </span><span class="c4 c0"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bgci.org/resources/history/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1525460810357000">https://www.bgci.org/resources/history/</a></span><span class="c6 c0">.
