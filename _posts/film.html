The film begins by introducing Stan Glantz, a prominent tobacco control lobbyist. Glantz takes the viewers into the beginning of the tobacco control movement when many prominent figures refused to believe that cigarettes had any correlation to heart disease. After receiving over 80 million pages from an inside source in the tobacco industry, Glantz discovered that not only were tobacco companies aware of the relationship between the two but that they were working to keep it all a secret. Representatives from the companies even went as far to try to prove that nicotine had no addictive affects. Tobacco companies worked to delay effective policy action, thus earning more money for themselves. This strategy used by tobacco companies was then imitaded by other major industries to try to earn more revenue without having to admit to any health risks: food, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, etc. Kepner then shifts the narrative to discuss actual physical risks of smoking cigarettes and the lack of flame retardant technology within the cigarette itself. When the cigarette companies started coming under fire for the number of house fires occuring as a result of a lit cigarette, the companies put the blame on furniture companies and the lack of flame retardant furniture within the household to withstand the burnt cigarette. Tobacco companies then put a representative from their companies into the Fire Marshall Union and the unions named him as the Legislative Representative. This representative was then able to move the tobacco narrative that furniture is the problem with house fires, not cigarettes. </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c1 c4">It&rsquo;s from this discussion of tobacco companies that Kepner then moves into a conversation surrounding climate change. James Hansen, climate scientist, testifies in 1988 around the correlation between the greenhouse effect and global warming. The science surrounding the topic climate change in 1988 was so new and not properly researched. At one point, researchers were even pushing an agenda that more pollution and CO2 can help make the planet &ldquo;more green.&rdquo; The media believed that there were not any real consensus among scientists regarding the conversation, however, after reading all of the published articles surrounding global climate change, it was clear that the scientific community was unanimous in its belief that greenhouse gases had a direct relationship with global warming. Scientists then realized that science actually had nothing to do with the discussion against global climate change - it had everything to do with political action and government intervention into big business. These major industries - food, tobacco, oil, etc - were getting upset about government policies being formed against their industries. Once the government starts inacting policy that affects their industry, revenue may be compromised. Non-scientific groups began publishing climate change reports that mirror the same format as the reports published actual scientific reports. The problem with this is that the public and government officials are having trouble determining the difference between the two reports. Researchers, the general public and the government seem to be afraid to actually have the conversation surrounding climate change and create solutions to stop it. The thought that our lifestyles will require significant change is scary for most people so it&rsquo;s easier to just act like it&rsquo;s not happening.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c1">From the film, &ldquo;Merchants of Doubt,&rdquo; the two theories that were showcased the most to the audience are: Framing and Two-Step Flow. The framing theory is related to agenda-setting theory, however, it focuses on the issue at hand instead of a particular topic. The concept of framing theory suggests that the media focuses attention on certain issues and then provides meaning. Ultimately, the way the media frames certain messages can impact the choices or attitudes of the audience consuming that message. The way &ldquo;Merchants of Doubt&rdquo; accomplishes this with the consistent metaphor used throughout the film that compares the issue of climate change to the tobacco epidemic. The director framed the idea that government officials are trying to place the blame of climate change on anything other than humans as a comparison against the tobacco industry placing blame of house fires and lung cancer on anything other than cigarette smoke. Currently, majority of society holds the opinion that smoking cigarettes are bad for your health and the environment. That being said, Richard Kepner felt the best way to explain the detriments of climate change and green house gases would be the compare it to something society has already deemed as bad. The audience then can make a mental note in their head that greenhouse gases and CO2 are equally as harmful as tobacco smoke. Once society realized tobacco smoke was not safe, they stopped smoking cigarettes. The hopes of the Kepner are that society will realize that greenhouses gases and CO2 are also harmful and they will begin to make lifestyle changes. </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c1">The Two-Step Flow theory asserts that information from the media moves into two phases. First, opinion leaders who pay close attention to the mass media and its messages recieve the information. Then, opinion leaders pass on their own interpretations in the addition to the messages received to the public. &ldquo;Merchants of Doubt&rdquo; achieved this theory by including a number of environmental scientists, politicians, and researchers into the film. These individuals are what are known as opinion leaders, or individuals who pay close attention to an issue, frequently discuss an issue, and consider themselves more persuasive in convincing others to adopt an opinion or course of action. Climate scientists, like James Hansen, were used to place the information presented in the film in context. Kepner placed opinion leaders like Hansen throughout the film to back up the argument. </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4 c1">The 2014 documentary, &ldquo;Merchants of Doubt&rdquo; did an amazing job of unpacking the conversation surrounding global climate change. Initially, I didn&rsquo;t understand it&rsquo;s correlation to the tobacco industry but as the film progressed I understood. Government officials are continuously changing the narrative surrounding climate change and the causes. Partisan beliefs are coming inbetween the real issue and government officials have no incentive to actually place the issue on the agenda. Since the release of the film, the conversation within the scientific community has increased, however, it seems every issue except the global climate seems to be discussed on the Capitol. Climate change has become a partisan issue which means the conversation can only occur if those in the majority agree that it is an actual problem - which currently is not the case. Personally, I took a lot from the film and the comparisons made between climate change and tobacco really helped convey the message. The issue of global climate change seems so straight-forward to me because of the unanimous research published by researchers that confirm human influence on the rise of temperature. </span></p><p class="c0 c3 c6"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3 c6"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3 c6"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3 c6"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c1">Works Cited</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Framing Theory.&rdquo; </span><span class="c1 c8">MassCommTheory</span><span class="c1">, masscommtheory.com/theory-overviews/framing-theory/.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kepner, Richard, director.</span><span class="c1 c8">&nbsp;Merchants of Doubt.</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;Mongrel Media, Sony Pictures Classics, 2014</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1">Kotcher, John E. and Nisbet, Matthew C. &ldquo;A Two-Step Flow of Influence: Opinion-Leader Campaigns on Climate Change.&rdquo; </span><span class="c1 c8">Science Communication,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;vol. 30, no. 3, Mar. 2009, pg. 329, doi: 10.1177/1075547008328797</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Two Step Flow Theory.&rdquo; </span><span class="c1 c8">Universiteit Twente</span><span class="c1">, 27 Feb. 2017, www.utwente.nl/en/bms/communication-theories/sorted-by-cluster/Mass%20Media/Two_Step_Flow_Theory-1/.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></body></html>
