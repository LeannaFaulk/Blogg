Reed in the </span><span class="c2 c9">The Art of Protest: Culture and Activism from the Civil Rights Movement to the Streets of Seattle</span><span class="c2">,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the arts function as cultural forms within social movements to transform society in numerous ways. Powerhouse countries like the United States were formed as a result of social movements like the Boston Tea Party and the American Revolution. Reed (2005) says the functions of the arts are to: encourage social change, empower and deepen commitment, inform large society about social issues, and harmonize social activits within the movement, inform internally to express or reinforce values and ideas, inform externally as a more effective way to communivate movement ideals to people outside of the movement, enact movement goals, directly historize to invent, tell and retell the history of the movement, set a new emotional tone, critique movement ideoly, and provide elements of pleasure and aesthetic joy. From the Industrial Revolution to the late 1930s, art and design are used as way to create controversy on the political, social, and economic events affecting one&rsquo;s country or the international community as a whole. Regardless of literacy rates or social stature, art has no boundaries or limitations. Through graphic design, artists have the ability to communicate messages or ideas to the public that may have gone unheard of. Pictorial Modernism, Social Realism and the invention of the Printing Press have played key roles in the communicative design of information surrounding political, social and economic events, respectively. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World War II, also known as the Second World War, was an international war that lasted from 1938 to 1945, although events leading up to the conflict go as far as 1919 with the Treaty of Versailles. The two opposining military alliances involved the Allies and the Axis. The Allies powers included the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain, and the Republic of China. The Axis powers included Nazi Germany, the Empire of Japan, and the Kingdom of Italy. World War II was the deadliest conflict in human histroy, marked by 50-85 million fatalities, most of which were civilians in the Soviet Union and China. The War included massacres, the genocide of the Holocaust, strategic bombing, starvation, disease, and the first use of nuclear weapons in history. During a time where civilians are being murdered on a daily basis and the government is in dire need of more volunteers for an already deadly war - poster design begins to play a stronger role in ever in communicating official messages to the public. Radio and other forms of technology have not yet developed or moved to mainstream, however, printing has had significant advances since its innovation. During the war, governments turned to the poster as a significant medium of propaganda and visual persuasion </span><span class="c2">(Meggs &amp; Pervis 297)</span><span class="c0">. Posters were used as means to communicate requirtment, demonization of the enemy, fundraising and conservation efforts on behalf of the government. </span></p><p class="c6 c12"><span class="c2">For the war, government were pushing all political, social and economic capital behind the war effort, placing a significant weight on the shoulders of civilians at home to conserve resources for the battlefield. Design concept, </span><span class="c1">Plakatstil,</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;emerged in Germany in reference to reductive, flat-color design school by fiftheen-year-old Lucian Bernhard (1883-1972). </span><span class="c1">Plakatstil</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;was the common design style used in propaganda posters by Austria-Hungary and Germany. Text and images were integrated simply and the essence of communication was conveyed by simplfying images into powerful shapes and patterns. Designer, Julius Klinger communicated very complex ideas in very simple designs. This is shown in the 1917 Klinger war loan poster that shows the death of a serpeant. This poster is a perfect example of </span><span class="c1">Plakatstil</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;because its use flat colors (green, white, red), simple text (number 8 and Kriegsanleihe), and sole image of the serpeant being pierced by arrows. While the design itself is simple, the message being communicated through the poster is the serpeant representing the Allied powers being killed by arrows while wrapped in the number 8 that acts as both a graphic and text element. When German forces started popularizing submarine warfare, Hans Rusi Erdt designed the 1916 poster that celebrated underwater hereos and rallied the public behind them. The Allies had a different approach to graphic propaganda postrt using more literal imagery to communicate messages. British posters stressed the need to protect traditional values, the home and family (Meggs &amp; Pervis 299). Examples include the very popular 1915 military recruiting poster by Alfred Leete showing Lord Horatio Kitchener, British secretary of war, pointing directly at the viewer. Both Britain and United States posters included very persuasvie headlines appealing directly to the viewers patriotism such as &ldquo;Your Country Needs YOU&rdquo; and &ldquo;I Want You For U.S. Army.&rdquo; Fictional characters like Uncle Sam by James Montgomery Flagg became popualar in the United States as imitation of the Kitchener poster. Both sides of the war used very strong propaganda techniques in their war posters - appeal to guilt, appeal to masculinity, sense of adventure, appeal to patriotism, and appeal to fear. </span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 212.50px; height: 317.56px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 212.50px; height: 317.56px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the lingering effects of the Great Depression of 1929, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt enacted the Works Progress Administration (WPA) providing many struggling artists with federal assistance, a sense of community, and the mandate to paint realistically. As a result, a large and diverse group of artist later called the &ldquo;Social Realists&rdquo; joined together to publish magazine, organize unions, convene artists&rsquo; congresses, and publickly agitate for the importance of their revolutionary work, the role of the artist within society and radical anti-capitalistic change for America </span><span class="c2">(The Art Story)</span><span class="c2">. Social realism is an international art movement between painters, printmakers, photographers and filmmakers. Inspiration drew from the everyday poor conditions of the working class and the poor. Social Realist arts encompasses portrayals of political and economic corruption. It oftentimes involves candid portraits and should be an accuraate portrayal of the scene and characters without embellishments. Social realists were very critical of the social structures, especially following the Great Depression. Grant Wood&rsquo;s </span><span class="c1">American Gothic</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;of 1930 has become a widely known icon of social realism because of its depiction of the steadfast American pioneering spirit. Social realist photography reached its peak with the work of Dorothea Lange, Walker Evans, and Ben Shahn. After World War I the booming U.S. farm economy collapsed from overproduction, falling prices, unfavorable weather, and increased mechanization. A number of farm laborers were out of work and forced into debt. In 1932, almost two million farm families lived in poverty, and millions of acres of farm lams had been ruined from soil erosion and poor farming practices. As a result, the Farm Security Administration (FSA) hired photographers to provide visual evidence that there was a need for government intervention. The social realism movement was not enslaved to the United States as it was alive and well in Europe following the Industrial Revolution. German artist Kathe Kollwitz created works such as </span><span class="c1">Praying Woman</span><span class="c2">, </span><span class="c1">Mother with her Dead Son</span><span class="c2">, and </span><span class="c1">Woman with Dead Child</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to broadcast the hardships of war and the economy affected women. </span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 229.71px; height: 298.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 229.71px; height: 298.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Industrial Revolution is said to have occurred first in England between 1760 and 1840 - it was a radical process of social and economic change (Meggs &amp; Pervis 151). The progress of the Industrial Revolution inevitable altered the printing process. According to </span><span class="c2 c9">The History of Graphic Design</span><span class="c2">, William Cowper obtained a patent for a printing press using curved stereotyped plates wrapped around a cylinder. 1827, the </span><span class="c1">Times</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;commissioned Cowper and his partner, Ambrose Applegath, to develop a four-cylinder steam-powered press using curved stereotyped plates more rapidly from papier-mache molds (Meggs &amp; Pervis 158). The press printed 4,000 sheets per hour, on both sides. German printers spearheaded color lithography, and the French printer Godefroy Engelmann patented the process called chromolithographie in 1837. After analyzing the colors contained within the original image, the printer seperate them into a series of printing plates and printed these component colors, one by one (Meggs &amp; Pervis 173). American chromolithography began in Boston with the innovation of &ldquo;the lightning press&rdquo; &nbsp;by Richard M. Hoe. Master draftsman, John H. Bufford was the next major innovator of chromolithography for his remarkable realism. His edition of the 1867 &ldquo;Swedish Song Quartett&rdquo; poster was meticulous in it&rsquo;s tonal drawing of the band. From Boston, chromolithography quickly spread to other cities and Louis Prang introduced consumers to an entirely diverse set of chromolithographs including food labels, catalogue covers, trade cards and Christmas cards. </span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 418.83px; height: 305.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 418.83px; height: 305.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lithography allowed for an entirely new way to communicate to consumers. From a marketing standpoint, the ability to add fluid and colorful lithographs to woodblock cuts &ldquo;extended the medium&rdquo; and made posters more of a spectacle. The idea of viewing posters in urban spaces and witnessing the art come to one made the visuals an experience - thus positively communicating to the public. Children were also able to benefit from this new art form with the innovation of colorful picture books and toy books. Children were no longer forced to read dense text heavy pieces of literature and a number of artist were pleased to have this unrestrained use of color or graphics. This was the beginning of a lot of heavy advertising and marketing efforts across Europe as companies noticed that affection and excitement patrons had for the posters. There was a significant rise in literacy, decrease in production costs and growth in advertising revenues. This allowed for a push in the number of newspapers and magazines published in the United States. Magazines were primarily used for advertising purposes in the 1870s - similar to that of today. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, advocacy is defined as &ldquo;the act or process of supporting a cause of proposal.&rdquo; From the Industrial Revolution to the 1930s, graphic artists used their creative influence to increase public communication surrounding the political, social and economic issues of that time. In times where literacy rates were low and technology was just entering the commercial market, designers were able to sell ideas, products, and lifestyles through multiple forms of art. From simple three element visuals like the </span><span class="c1">Plakatstil</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;posters to complex story-telling photographs of social realism, the artists were successfully able to communicate their message to the audience. These design movements proved that art has the capabilities to spark real change in the international community because of it&rsquo;s limitless potential. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Works Cited</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c0">Purvis, Alston W. &ldquo;Pictorial Modernism.&rdquo; History of Graphic Design, by Phillip B.
